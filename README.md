![ScreenShot](https://github.com/leecom3025/oPsai-x86/blob/master/res/drawable-mdpi/github_logo.png)

====================================================
oPsai project is a client side PCloud in Android.

This is oPsai daemon test version for x86 archi. 

The project is being built on Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 GT-P5210 
(x86 powered by Intel) with Android version 4.2.2(JDQ39.P5210XXUAMG6),
Kernel version 3.4.34-1135839 and CWR version 6.9. 

Thought it is a branch of LibVNCServer, it rarely uses the code or plugins. 

As someone (JS), "HIGHLY QUALIFIED" software developer did not have time to answer a few questions, I decided to take the problem from the scractch and update it. 

Unlike SOMEONE, shot me an email if you have a question.
